I am Kiran Dabbiril. I am from Visakhapatnam (City of Destiny), Andhra
Pradesh which is located in India. I worked as a Process Analyst with
Deputy Manager designation in the well esteemed organization ICICI Bank
Pvt. Ltd. I have experience of more than 3 years in internal audit
process. My role was to find the anomalies in the jewel loan product and
submit the anomalies to the respective stakeholders by raising the
service requests. I was also a part of the in developing a project where
the text extracted from food and transport receipts uploaded by the
ICICI employees. This has reduced the throughput time for data cleaning
for 8 hours and increased the efficiency by reducing the manual efforts.
I have knowledge in python, Fraud Analysis, SQL, Jupyter and all the
Customer Operations. I also play a major role in reporting all the
anomalies and critical findings related substandard activities and
recommend the necessary steps for the compliance closure.

I am pursuing my Master’s in Data Analytics Engineering in George Mason
University, Fairfax located in Virginia state in United States of
America. I completed by undergrad in the field of Computer Science in
Andhra University which is located in Andhra Pradesh. I scored a GPA of
8.02 with distinction. During my undergrad I did my project on Detecting
Anomalies Users Behavior On Social Networking. I was the team lead in my
undergrad project. In his project we aimed at understanding the users’
patterns in the dataset that is available at Andhra University for
educational purposes. We collected a nearly one million row dataset that
contains users' personas like name, age, gender, along with user actions
such as number of clicks, number of messages sent, Posts shared. We then
trained a K-means unsupervised model on a sample small data set to
detect outliers. From this K-means output, we drafted a labelled dataset
with two classes for fraud detection and non-fraud detection and then
used Logistic regression modeling to classify the user profile to be
anomalous or normal. The experience in ICICI Bank made me so confident
in my skills and work. I used to handle a team and conducts internal
audits all over the state and find the anomalies and submit the same to
the respective stakeholders. During this process I learnt how to handle
a team and how to organize the work responsibilities accordingly. During
my undergrad, I was the team lead in all the projects, events and many
fest fairs organized which made my skills grew and helped me in my work.
I I was the class representative and assisted the professors in all the
class hold activities. I also attended the seminars on Artificial
Intelligence, Web Security, Microsoft Azure where I gained a lot of
knowledge in these fields. I did my internship in HEWLETT PACKARD on
developing a web application on online shopping using CORE JAVA, JSP
where it uses JDBC to interface the database. I also participated in
SMART INDIA HACKTHON conducted by the DIGITAL INDIA in 2017 and was
nominated in finale.

Currently, I am focusing on upskilling my technologies which helps me to
handle data analysts programming and also I have a future goal to become
Data Analyst or Data Scientist in one of the reputed companies. I am
preparing myself in enhancing my skills in the field of data analytics.
I am looking forward to apply my skills in new and challenging
environments.
