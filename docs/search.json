I am from Visakhapatnam (City of Destiny), Andhra Pradesh which is located in India. I worked as a Process Analyst with Deputy Manager designation in the well esteemed organization ICICI Bank Pvt. Ltd. I have experience of more than 3 years in internal audit process. My role was to find the anomalies in the jewel loan product and submit the anomalies to the respective stakeholders by raising the service requests. I was also a part of the in developing a project where the text extracted from food and transport receipts uploaded by the ICICI employees. This has reduced the throughput time for data cleaning for 8 hours and increased the efficiency by reducing the manual efforts. I have knowledge in python, Fraud Analysis, SQL, Jupyter and all the Customer Operations. I also play a major role in reporting all the anomalies and critical findings related substandard activities and recommend the necessary steps for the compliance closure.\nI am pursuing my Master’s in Data Analytics Engineering in George Mason University, Fairfax located in Virginia state in United States of America. I completed by undergrad in the field of Computer Science in Andhra University which is located in Andhra Pradesh. I scored a GPA of 8.02 with distinction. During my undergrad I did my project on Detecting Anomalies Users Behavior On Social Networking. I was the team lead in my undergrad project. In his project we aimed at understanding the users’ patterns in the dataset that is available at Andhra University for educational purposes. We collected a nearly one million row dataset that contains users’ personas like name, age, gender, along with user actions such as number of clicks, number of messages sent, Posts shared. We then trained a K-means unsupervised model on a sample small data set to detect outliers. From this K-means output, we drafted a labelled dataset with two classes for fraud detection and non-fraud detection and then used Logistic regression modeling to classify the user profile to be anomalous or normal. The experience in ICICI Bank made me so confident in my skills and work. I used to handle a team and conducts internal audits all over the state and find the anomalies and submit the same to the respective stakeholders. During this process I learnt how to handle a team and how to organize the work responsibilities accordingly. During my undergrad, I was the team lead in all the projects, events and many fest fairs organized which made my skills grew and helped me in my work. I I was the class representative and assisted the professors in all the class hold activities. I also attended the seminars on Artificial Intelligence, Web Security, Microsoft Azure where I gained a lot of knowledge in these fields. I did my internship in HEWLETT PACKARD on developing a web application on online shopping using CORE JAVA, JSP where it uses JDBC to interface the database. I also participated in SMART INDIA HACKTHON conducted by the DIGITAL INDIA in 2017 and was nominated in finale.\nCurrently, I am focusing on upskilling my technologies which helps me to handle data analysts programming and also I have a future goal to become Data Analyst or Data Scientist in one of the reputed companies. I am preparing myself in enhancing my skills in the field of data analytics. I am looking forward to apply my skills in new and challenging environments."

    "text": "Towards Detecting Compromised Accounts On Social Network\nABSTRACT\nCompromising social network accounts has become a profitable course of action for cybercriminals. By hijacking control of a popular media or business account, attackers can distribute their malicious messages or disseminate fake information to a large user base. The impacts of these incidents range from a tarnished reputation to multi-billion dollar monetary losses on financial markets. In our previous work, we demonstrated how we can detect large-scale compromises (i.e., so-called campaigns) of regular online social network users. In this work, we show how we can use similar techniques to identify compromises of individual high-profile accounts. High-profile accounts frequently have one characteristic that makes this detection reliable – they show consistent behavior over time. We show that our system, were it deployed, would have been able to detect and prevent three real-world attacks against popular companies and news agencies. Furthermore, our system, in contrast to popular media, would not have fallen for a staged compromise instigated by a US restaurant chain for publicity reasons.\nProblem Statement:\nMalicious parties exploit the well-established connections and trust relationships between the legitimate account owners and their friends, and efficiently distribute spam ads, phishing links, or malware, while avoiding being blocked by the service providers.\nMajor OSNs today employ IP geolocation logging to battle against account compromisation. However, this approach is known to suffer from low detection granularity and high false positive rate.\nURL blacklisting has the challenge of timely maintenance and update, and message clustering introduces significant overhead when subjected to a large number of real-time messages.\nExisting System:\nWe focused on large-scale compromises that affect thousands of social network accounts at the same time, in this paper we also look at isolated compromises that affect high- profile accounts. We show that such accounts typically show a very consistent behavior, and therefore COMPA can reliably detect compromises against them. To demonstrate this, we analyzed four compromises of high-profile accounts that made the news during the past three years.\nProposed System:\nIn this paper, we suggest to build a social behavior profile for OSN users to characterize their behavioral styles. Our approach takes into consideration both extroversive and introversive behaviors. Based at the characterized social behavioral profiles, we are in a position to distinguish customers from others, which may be without problems employed for compromised account detection. Specifically, we introduce eight behavioral features to portray a user’s social behaviors, which include both its extroversive posting and introversive browsing activities. A user’s statistical distributions of those feature values comprise its behavioral profile. While users’ behavior profiles diverge, individual user’s activities are highly likely to conform to its behavioral profile. This fact is hence employed to discover a compromised account, seeing that impostors’ social behaviors can rarely comply with the true consumer’s behavioral profile.\n DATA FLOW DIAGRAM:\nThe DFD is also called as bubble chart. It is a simple graphical formalism that can be used to represent a system in terms of input data to the system, various processing carried out on this data, and the output data is generated by this system.\nThe data flow diagram (DFD) is one of the most important modeling tools. It is used to model the system components. These components are the system process, the data used by the process, an external entity that interacts with the system and the information flows in the system.\nDFD shows how the information moves through the system and how it is modified by a series of transformations. It is a graphical technique that depicts information flow and the transformations that are applied as data moves from input to output.\nDFD is also known as bubble chart. A DFD may be used to represent a system at any level of abstraction. DFD may be partitioned into levels that represent increasing information flow and functional detail.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nMODULES:\n·      OSN System Construction Module\n·      Building Social Behavior Features\n·      Data Collection of User Click streams\n·      Compromised Account Detection\nMODULES DESCSRIPTION:\nOSN System Construction Module\n·      In the first module, we develop the Online Social Networking (OSN) system module. We build up the system with the feature of Online Social Networking. Where, this module is used for new user registrations and after registrations the users can login with their authentication.\n·      Where after the existing users can send messages to privately and publicly, options are built. Users can also share post with others. The user can able to search the other user profiles and public posts. In this module users can also accept and send friend requests.\n·      With all the basic feature of Online Social Networking System modules is build up in the initial module, to prove and evaluate our system features.\nBuilding Social Behavior Features\n·      In this module, we develop the system by building social behavior features module. We categorize user social behaviors on an OSN into two classes, extroversive behaviors and introversive behaviors.\n·      Extroversive behaviors, such as uploading photos and sending messages, result in visible imprints to one or more peer users; introversive behaviors, such as browsing other users’ profiles and searching in message inbox, however, do not produce observable effects to other users. Extroversive Behaviors directly reflect how a user interacts with its friends online, and thus they are important for characterizing a user’s social behaviors.\n·      Although invisible to peer users, introversive behaviors make up the majority of a user’s OSN activity; as studied in previous work the dominant (i.e., over 90%) user behavior on an OSN is browsing. Through introversive activities users gather and consume social information, which helps them to form ideas and opinions, and eventually, establish social connections and initiate future social communications. Hence, introversive behavior patterns make up an essential part of a user’s online social behavioral characteristics.\nData Collection of User Click streams\n·      In this module we develop the data collection process using the Click Streams. The click streams in our dataset are organized in units of “sessions”. We denote the start of a session when a user starts to visit our OSN in any window or tab of a browser; the end of a session is denoted when the user closes all windows or tabs that visit our OSN, or navigates away from our OSN in all windows or tabs of the browser. Click streams from concurrently opened tabs/windows are grouped into a single session, but are recorded individually (i.e., events from one window/tab are not merged with those from another window/tab).\n·      We further process each click stream before performing detailed measurement analysis. We detect and remove click streams in the “idle” periods—significantly long time intervals in which no user activity is observed, by analyzing the request timestamp and URLs. For example, users may go away from their computers while leaving their browsers running. With idle periods removed, we plot the “effective” cumulative click stream lengths for each participating user.\n·      We observe that the click stream lengths follow exponential distribution. During a three-week period, the least active user only accumulates half an hour of activities. We also plot the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of single session lengths across all users. It is evident that the distribution of single session length is heavy-tailed.\nCompromised Account Detection\n·      In this module, we first detail the formation of a user social behavioral profile using our proposed behavioral features.\n·      Based on our OSN measurement study, we quantify OSN user behavior patterns into a set of three metrics that correspond to the social behavioral features.\n·      The social behavior profile of an individual user can thus be built by combining the respective social behavioral metrics. Then, we describe the application of social behavior profiles in differentiating users and detecting compromised accounts.\n·      The social behavioral profile depicts various aspects of a user’s online social behavior patterns, and it enables us to quantitatively describe the differences in distinct user social behaviors. In this module, we first describe how to compare social behavioral profiles by calculating their difference. Then, we discuss the application of social behavioral profile comparison to distinguishing different users and detecting compromised accounts. Together with the self variance, we can apply profile comparison to distinguish different users and detect compromised accounts.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we propose to build a social behavior profile for individual OSN users to characterize their behavioral patterns. Our approach takes into account both extroversive and introversive behaviors. Based on the characterized social behavioral profiles, we are able to distinguish a users from others, which can be easily employed for compromised account detection. Specifically, we introduce eight behavioral features to portray a user’s social behaviors, which include both its extroversive posting and introversive browsing activities. A user’s statistical distributions of those feature values comprise its behavioral profile. While users’ behavior profiles diverge, individual user’s activities are highly likely to conform to its behavioral profile. This fact is thus employed to detect a compromised account, since impostors’ social behaviors can hardly conform to the authentic user’s behavioral profile. Our evaluation on sample Facebook users indicates that we can achieve high detection accuracy when behavioral profiles are built in a complete and accurate fashion."
